## 🌸 About Me

Hi! I'm **Nathasya Aulia Putri**, also known as **Nana** ✨  
I'm a student developer who loves blending **design, storytelling, and code** into interactive web experiences.

I enjoy creating:
- 🎮 Game-like websites  
- 🎨 Pixel-art inspired UI  
- 🌱 Calm, cozy, and emotional interactions  

Most of my projects are inspired by games and narrative-driven design.
